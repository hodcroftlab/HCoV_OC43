Waiting at most 5 seconds for missing files.
MissingOutputException in rule extract in file /mnt/c/Users/msomno/Documents/GitHub/HCoV_OC43/Snakefile, line 101:
Job 0 completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
nucleocapsid/results/extracted.fasta (missing locally, parent dir contents: )
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
